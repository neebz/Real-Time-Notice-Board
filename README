What the heck is it?
Its a web app where anyone can post anything and it will get notified to all other clients.

What I need ?
1. NodeJs
2. Nowjs
3. Knockoutjs*
4. Coffeekup
5. Expressjs


How to make it work?
After installing the dependencies, just run node app.js.

What? That's it?
Yup. Just checking the amazing power of Nowjs.


*Knockout's data-bind was conflicting with Coffeekup for some strange reason. So I changed the code and am using databind (without the hypen)
